# Reviewbot

This is the source code of the is-a.dev Reviewbot! The bot uses [octokit.js](https://github.com/octokit/octokit.js) as the library.

## Requirements

- Node.js
- A GitHub App subscribed to **Pull Request** events and with the following permissions:
  - Pull requests: Read & write
  - Metadata: Read-only
- (For local development) A tunnel to expose your local server to the internet (e.g. [smee](https://smee.io/), [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/))
- Your GitHub App Webhook must be configured to receive events at a URL that is accessible from the internet.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2. Create a `.env` file similar to `.env.example` and set actual values.
3. Install dependencies with `npm`.
4. Start the server with `npm run server`.
5. Ensure your server is reachable from the internet.
    - If you're using `smee`, run `smee -u <smee_url> -t http://localhost:3000/api/webhook`.
6. Ensure your GitHub App includes at least one repository on its installations.
